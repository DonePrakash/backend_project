    1. const uploadOnCloudinary = async (localFilePath) => {

        This is an async function named uploadOnCloudinary.
        It takes one parameter: localFilePath, which is the location of the file on your local system.
    2. Check if file exists
        try {
            if(!localFilePath) return null;

        It first checks if localFilePath is empty or undefined.
        If there's no file path, it returns null immediately.
    3. Upload files to cloudinary
        const response = await cloudinary.uploader.upload
        (localFilePath, {
            resource_type: "auto"
        });

        Calls cloudinary.uploader.upload() to upload the file to Cloudinary.
        The second argument { resource_type: "auto" } tells Cloudinary to detect the file type automatically (image, video, etc.).
        The await keyword waits for the upload process to finish before moving to the next line.
    4. fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath):
        This deletes the local file to free up space since the upload failed.
